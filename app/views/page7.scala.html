<h1>You decide to call it a day.</h1>
<article>
<p>You return to camp only to find everything ransacked.</p>
<p>Seriously, it looks like an elephant came in and kicked everything followed by a rave of badgers.</p>
<p>You spend the remainder of the day trying to put everything back in order and spend the following night.</p>
<p> looking at the stars through the massive hole in the roof of your tent.</p>
<p>During this time, you reflect on your life choices up until this moment.</p>
<p>I mean, you just graduated from law school last year, shouldnâ€™t you be taking advantage of that?</p>
<p>But then again, the woods are a nice place to get away from the obligations of society. </p>
<p>And who knows? Maybe if you do find Bigfoot you will become famous.</p>

<p>Do you want to <a href="@routes.Application.page11" class="btn btn-default">Continue your investigation of finding Bigfoot</a></p>
<p>Or are you ready to go home and <a href="@routes.Application.page12" class="btn btn-default">become the outstanding member of society </a> that you were meant to be.</p>

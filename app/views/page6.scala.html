<article>
<p>The footsteps are getting closer,</p>
<p>but you being the trooper that you are, have done an exceptional job of ignoring them.</p>
<p>This hasnâ€™t at all discouraged the thing but has in fact caused it to grow bolder in its deadly hunt.</p>
<p>You are probably being stalked by a puma, or a bear and are running out of options in getting away from it.</p>
